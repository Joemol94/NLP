# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including text summarization, sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews, YouTube comment scraping and sentiment analysis, and question answering using BERT.

## Overview

NLP tasks play a crucial role in understanding and processing human language. This repository explores different NLP techniques and methodologies to tackle diverse tasks.

## Tasks

### Question Answering

The `QuestionAnswering.ipynb` notebook focuses on question answering using state-of-the-art models. It utilizes a pre-fine-tuned BERT model on the SQuAD dataset. The process involves tokenizing the input, obtaining model scores, and extracting the answer span. Leveraging tools like Hugging Face's Transformer classes and pretrained/fine-tuned models streamlines the development process and enhances the model's performance.

### Text Summarization

The `Text_Summarization.ipynb` notebook demonstrates text summarization techniques. It explores methods to condense large bodies of text into concise summaries, facilitating easier understanding and information extraction.

### Sentiment Analysis

#### Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis

The `sentiment analysis.ipynb` notebook delves into sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews. Leveraging libraries like NLTK and naive Bayes classifiers, it analyzes textual data to determine sentiment polarity, aiding businesses in understanding customer feedback.

#### YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis

The `YouTube Comments.ipynb` notebook focuses on scraping YouTube comments and performing sentiment analysis. It extracts comments from YouTube videos and utilizes NLP techniques to gauge sentiment, providing insights into viewer opinions and feedback.

## Usage

Utilize Google Colab for running these notebooks to leverage its free GPU and TPU resources, which significantly accelerate model training and inference. Follow the instructions provided in each notebook to execute the code and perform the respective NLP tasks.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed for running the code in each notebook. Commonly used libraries include NLTK, Transformers, and other NLP-related packages.
